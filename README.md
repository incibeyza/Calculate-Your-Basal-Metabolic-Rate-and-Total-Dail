# Calculate-Your-Basal-Metabolic-Rate-and-Total-Dail

This Python code implements the Harris Benedict equation to calculate an individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). The BMR is the number of calories needed to sustain basic body functions at rest, while the TDEE is the total number of calories an individual needs to consume in order to maintain their current weight, including the energy required for physical activity.

To use the code, simply enter your age, gender, weight, height, and activity level in the input fields provided. The code will then calculate your BMR and TDEE and display the results for you.

The code includes two functions: calculate_bmr and calculate_tdee. The calculate_bmr function uses the Harris Benedict equation to calculate the BMR based on the user's age, gender, weight, and height. The calculate_tdee function uses the BMR and the user's activity level to calculate the TDEE.

I hope you find this code useful! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further assistance with Python programming.
